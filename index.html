      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently enrolled at the University of Richmond's Coding Bootcamp! At the end of July 2020, I'll be certified as a full-stack software developer!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Charlottesville, Va.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to travel, paint, listen to music and podcasts, workout (sometimes), and of course Netflix.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>At the end of the program, I would definitely want to start my career in software development. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of as many opportunities help advance my career. Eventually, I would love to work for a music streaming company like Tidal or Spotify or either with a startup company.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to become a software developer, because I’ve always been fascinated by learning about new technologies and ideas. With the way the world is shaping, I feel like if we aren’t up to speed with advancements in technology, then we won’t have a bigger understanding of the world changing around us. Software Development is a limitlessly expanding field and will keep evolving  throughout the future.</p>
